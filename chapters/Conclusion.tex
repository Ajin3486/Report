% Conclusion (~1.5 pages)

\section{Summary}
% To complete (~0.5 page):
% - Successfully implemented residual RL pipeline: ROS2 trajectory generation + Isaac Lab training + domain randomization validation
% - Main result: Policy achieves 97% success in baseline, 88% with 3cm calibration error, 91% with moderate sensor noise
% - Key finding: Residual learning (MoveIt + PPO) significantly outperforms baseline MoveIt alone

\section{Contributions and Limitations}
% To complete (~0.5 page):
% - Methodological contribution: Complete pipeline with domain randomization validation
% - Technical contribution: Demonstrated robustness to calibration/sensor uncertainties
% - Limitations:
%   * No physical robot validation (time constraint)
%   * Synthetic vision vs real camera (lighting, occlusions not modeled)
%   * Performance degrades with extreme perturbations (>5cm offset, >5mm noise)

\section{Future Work}
% To complete (~0.5 page):
% - Short term: Deploy on real UR10, measure actual Reality Gap
% - Medium term: 
%   * Integrate real camera with AprilTag detection
%   * Test on more complex tasks (pick-and-place)
%   * Try other RL algorithms (SAC, TD3)
% - Long term: Multi-robot generalization, industrial deployment
